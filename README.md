# Lunchtime Andel (Experimental Meteor version)
This project is just a result of experimenting with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). Original project is [horejsek/lunchtimeandel](https://github.com/horejsek/lunchtimeandel).

## Be aware that this project
- is only experiment
- can be cancelled anytime
- most likely doesn't implement all Meteor best practices
- contains a lot of hardcoded, shitty code
- shows me how interesting Meteor is :-)
